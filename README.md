**Project Overview: Optimizing Patient Care with Advanced Predictive Modeling**

**Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vetrirah/av-healthcare2

**Objective:**
In this project, the main goal was to leverage machine learning techniques to enhance the efficiency of hospital operations by predicting the length of stay for patients. The accurate prediction of patient stays is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and streamlining healthcare processes.

**Project Highlights:**

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
   - Loaded and explored the training data from a CSV file.
   - Addressed missing values in 'Bed Grade' and 'City_Code_Patient' through mode imputation.
   - Applied Label Encoding to the categorical 'Stay' column.

2. **Model Exploration and Selection:**
   - Investigated various machine learning models, including XGBoost, LightGBM, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and a Neural Network.
   - Evaluated each model's performance and accuracy.
   - Chose LightGBM as the preferred model based on superior predictive capabilities.

3. **Model Implementation and Predictions:**
   - Trained the selected LightGBM model on the training data.
   - Utilized the trained model to predict patient stays in the test data.
   - Organized and presented the prediction results for further analysis.

**Conclusion:**
This project provides a comprehensive overview of employing advanced predictive modeling to optimize patient care and hospital efficiency. By selecting and implementing the LightGBM model, I aim to make accurate predictions of patient stays, leading to improved resource management and streamlined healthcare operations. Future endeavors include refining the model and potential deployment for real-time predictions in healthcare management.
